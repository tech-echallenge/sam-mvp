Those with digital literacy enjoy advantages like increased earnings, career flexibility, and active civic engagement. However, economic factors, educational resource limitations, and psychological barriers prevent universal digital literacy.\n\nTo bridge this gap, it is essential to integrate digital literacy into all levels of education and provide training in public spaces. Focusing on infrastructure and skills training for underserved communities and addressing the needs of older adults are crucial steps. Universal digital literacy is key to reducing the digital divide and ensuring fair access to technology-driven opportunities."
