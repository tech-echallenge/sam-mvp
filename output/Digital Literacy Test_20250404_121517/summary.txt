Digital literacy is a vital skill that impacts people of all ages and backgrounds. Around 30% of adults worldwide lack digital skills, creating barriers to success. Those with digital literacy enjoy advantages like increased earnings, career flexibility, and active civic engagement. However, economic factors, educational resource limitations, and psychological barriers prevent universal digital literacy.

To bridge this gap, it is essential to integrate digital literacy into all levels of education and provide training in public spaces. Focusing on infrastructure and skills training for underserved communities and addressing the needs of older adults are crucial steps. Universal digital literacy is key to reducing the digital divide and ensuring fair access to technology-driven opportunities.
