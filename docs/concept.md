# First Principles Text Decomposition and Synthesis

## Core Concept

Our application decomposes text into fundamental components, then synthesizes these components into a concise summary with visual aids. This process follows a systematic breakdown and reconstruction approach:

1. **Decomposition**: Text → Paragraphs → Sentences → Core Meanings
2. **Synthesis**: Core Meanings → Structured Argument → Concise Summary

## Process Flow

### Text Decomposition (Top-Down)
1. **Document Analysis**: Parse the document, identify key sections (abstract, conclusion, body)
2. **Paragraph Classification**: Assign a structural tag to each paragraph (thesis, point, example, conclusion)
3. **Sentence Extraction**: Break paragraphs into constituent sentences
4. **Core Extraction**: For each sentence, extract:
   - Gist: The essential meaning in simple language
   - Image tag: A visual concept that represents the meaning

### Knowledge Reconstruction (Bottom-Up)
1. **Point Assembly**: Group related sentence gists into coherent points
2. **Argument Formation**: Connect points into a logical argument structure
3. **Summary Generation**: Traverse the argument tree to produce a concise summary
4. **Visual Enhancement**: Generate complementary images from image tags

By following this structured approach, we can represent complex text as a simplified tree structure that preserves the core meaning while significantly reducing length.
